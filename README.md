# 🎯 Event Go - Event User Application Testing Repository  

## 🏆 About the Project  
**Event Go** is an event booking application designed for users to explore, book, and manage tickets for various events like **concerts, weddings, corporate gatherings, and private parties**.  

As a **Software Tester**, I followed a structured approach to testing this application, covering everything from requirements analysis to test execution. This repository showcases the entire **testing lifecycle**, including:  

✅ **Requirement Analysis**  
✅ **Test Planning**  
✅ **UI/UX Design Validation (Figma)**  
✅ **Test Case & Scenario Design**  
✅ **Test Execution & Defect Management**
